To publish your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI), you need to create a distribution package and upload it. Here are the steps you should follow:
fix error
--------------------------------------------------------------
pip install -U pip setuptools twine
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install necessary tools:

First, make sure you have the necessary tools installed. You need setuptools and wheel to create the distribution package, and twine to upload it.

You can install them using pip:

bash
--------------------------------------------------------------
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
--------------------------------------------------------------
2. Create a distribution package:

Navigate to the same directory where setup.py is located and run the following command:

bash
--------------------------------------------------------------
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
--------------------------------------------------------------
This command will generate a dist/ directory which will contain your built source archive and wheel.

3. Test your distribution (optional but recommended):

Before you upload your package to PyPI, you might want to check if everything is okay with your package. You can install it locally with pip to test it:

bash
--------------------------------------------------------------
pip install dist/NoomSmartKeyboard-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
--------------------------------------------------------------
Replace YourPackageName-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl with the name of the .whl file that was generated in your dist/ directory.

4. Create an account on PyPI:

If you don't already have an account on PyPI, create one now. You'll need it in the next step to upload your package.

5. Upload your distribution package:

With twine, you can upload your distribution package as follows:

bash
--------------------------------------------------------------
twine upload dist/*
--------------------------------------------------------------
This command will ask you for your username and password. After you provide them, twine will upload all the packages in the dist/ directory to PyPI.

Now your package should be available on PyPI and can be installed by anyone using pip:

bash
--------------------------------------------------------------
pip install NoomSmartKeyboard
--------------------------------------------------------------
Replace YourPackageName with the name of your package.

NOTE: Be sure that everything is working as expected before uploading your package to PyPI. Once a version of a package is released and uploaded to PyPI, you cannot replace that version. If you need to make changes, you'll need to release a new version.
